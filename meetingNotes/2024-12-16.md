PKIX Attestation Design Team meeting 12/16/2024


Attendees:
* Mike Ounsworth
* Ned Smith
* JP Fiset
* Henk Birkholtz
* John Kempt

ACTION ITEM (decided): the draft-dwt should remove any new claims not already in EAT. Henk suggests just moving them into the Key Attestation draft (rather than make a 3rd draft).

ACTION ITEM: Mike to cancel the meeting over the holidays

ACTION ITEM: we need to think about how to convey 3rd party software / firmware running inside the HSM hardware boundary.


Suggestion from Ned: can we reuse the ECT structures defined in https://github.com/ietf-rats-wg/draft-ietf-rats-corim ?




Question: do we in fact have multiple subjects (ie a platform and a key, or multiple keys), or not? Can we consider that this is fundamentally an attestation about the key, and all the "platform" type claims as attributes of the key?

Example:

{
 KeyId 1234
 Exportable: false
 NeverExportable: true
 FipsBoot: true
 Oemid: nshield
 Hwmodel: XC
 Hmversion: 1.07
 Hwserial: 9876543
 EnvID: "tenant 4567"
 Dbgstat: disabled
 nonce: 0x36798
}



Question: if we have multiple keys to attest, how do we represent that?

Option 1
Here, conceptually we have three subjects: "KeyID 1234", "KeyID 5678", and "Hwserial 9876543"
{
 keys: [ {KeyId 1234, Exportable: false, NeverExportable: true, EnvID: "tenant 4567"},
	 {KeyId 5678, Exportable: false, NeverExportable: true, EnvID: "tenant 4568"} ]
 FipsBoot: true
 Oemid: nshield
 Hwmodel: XC
 Hmversion: 1.07
 Hwserial: 9876543
 Dbgstat: disabled
 nonce: 0x36798
}


OR, just do multiple big attestations

Option 2
Here, conceptually we have two subjects: "KeyID 1234", "KeyID 5678"

{
 KeyId 1234
 Exportable: false
 NeverExportable: true
 FipsBoot: true
 Oemid: nshield
 Hwmodel: XC
 Hmversion: 1.07
 Hwserial: 9876543
 Dbgstat: disabled
 nonce: 0x36798
}

{
 KeyId 5678
 Exportable: false
 NeverExportable: true
 FipsBoot: true
 Oemid: nshield
 Hwmodel: XC
 Hmversion: 1.07
 Hwserial: 9876543
 Dbgstat: disabled
 nonce: 0x36798
}


Interesting discussion on this point, some preference for Option 2, but needs to sink into brains and be discussed more.
