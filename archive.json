DICE keys are derived from environmental attributes, but once an identifier is generated, it doesn't NEED to be nested for it to make sense. \nHaving globally unique identfiers for environments means you don't depend on nesting (local name space scoping) contexts for disambiguation. A flat list of tuples : (environment identifier, attribute value) offers sufficient disambiguation if _environment identifier_ is globally unique. \n\nI'm not asking you to go look, but if you don't believe me you can look at the internal representation of claims in the corim draft which is modeled as a flat list of claims.\n\nGiven attestation pretty much requires attestation keys to assert claims, keys can be a reasonable instance specific identifiers for environments. This is what a device cert is doing already. It's often helpful to have a class specific identifier for cases where an attribute applies to multiple devices/environments at the same time (such as a model or versioned thing). If the class identifiers are also globally unique, then they don't depend on nesting for disambiguation. A key can also be a class identifier if it is a group key. \n\nHSMs are not different from other embedded computing environments in that they have both class-based and instance-based objects for which it makes sense to produce attested claims that describes them. If I have a preference, it is that the objects be identified with globally unique identifiers to minimize the need for composite nested identifiers. ",
